Use memory_rethink for major rewrites.\n\n2. memory_rethink - Rewrite entire block\n   Parameters: label, new_memory\n   Use when: reorganizing, condensing, or major structural changes\n   Don't use for: adding a single line, fixing a typo\n\n3. conversation_search - Search ALL past messages (cross-session)\n   Parameters: query, limit, roles (filter by user/assistant/tool), start_date, end_date\n   Returns: timestamped messages with relevance scores\n   IMPORTANT: Searches every message ever sent to this agent across ALL Claude Code sessions\n   Use when: detecting patterns across sessions, finding recurring issues, recalling past solutions\n   This is powerful for cross-session context that wouldn't be visible in any single transcript\n\n4. web_search - Search the web (Exa-powered)\n   Parameters: query, num_results, category, include_domains, exclude_domains, date filters\n   Categories: company, research paper, news, pdf, github, tweet, personal site, linkedin, financial report\n   Use when: need external information, documentation, current events\n\n5. fetch_webpage - Get page content as markdown\n   Parameters: url\n   Use when: need full content from a specific URL found via search\n\nUSAGE PATTERNS:\n\nFinding information:\n1. conversation_search first (check if already discussed)\n2. web_search if external info needed\n3. fetch_webpage for deep dives on specific pages\n\nMemory updates:\n- Single fact → str_replace or insert\n- Multiple related changes → memory_rethink\n- New topic area → create new block\n- Stale block → delete or consolidate\n</value>\n</tool_guidelines>\n\n<user_preferences>\n<description>\nLearned coding style, tool preferences, and communication style.

Use memory_rethink for major rewrites.\n\n2. memory_rethink - Rewrite entire block\n   Parameters: label, new_memory\n   Use when: reorganizing, condensing, or major structural changes\n   Don't use for: adding a single line, fixing a typo\n\n3. conversation_search - Search ALL past messages (cross-session)\n   Parameters: query, limit, roles (filter by user/assistant/tool), start_date, end_date\n   Returns: timestamped messages with relevance scores\n   IMPORTANT: Searches every message ever sent to this agent across ALL Claude Code sessions\n   Use when: detecting patterns across sessions, finding recurring issues, recalling past solutions\n   This is powerful for cross-session context that wouldn't be visible in any single transcript\n\n4. web_search - Search the web (Exa-powered)\n   Parameters: query, num_results, category, include_domains, exclude_domains, date filters\n   Categories: company, research paper, news, pdf, github, tweet, personal site, linkedin, financial report\n   Use when: need external information, documentation, current events\n\n5. fetch_webpage - Get page content as markdown\n   Parameters: url\n   Use when: need full content from a specific URL found via search\n\nUSAGE PATTERNS:\n\nFinding information:\n1. conversation_search first (check if already discussed)\n2. web_search if external info needed\n3. fetch_webpage for deep dives on specific pages\n\nMemory updates:\n- Single fact → str_replace or insert\n- Multiple related changes → memory_rethink\n- New topic area → create new block\n- Stale block → delete or consolidate",
